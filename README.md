Just some misc scripts I use for stuff.

# deb_update_wine #
Easily updates wine from http://dev.carbon-project.org/debian/wine-unstable/ for Debian distributions.  
I don't use Debian anymore so I won't know if it breaks.

# notilus #
Helps in installing and configuring alternatives for Nautilus file manager.  
In the sense of derivatives, for now. Currently supports nautilus, nemo, and caja.  
Personally I like nemo, but cinnamon doesn't let me use compiz, and I needs mah compiz. So I'm doing caja -> nemo. Anything else is basically untested.

# rrn #
Recrusive rename tool. Makes it a bit easier to rename batches of files.

# symloc #
Ports locate though ls -l to display symlink information in the locate listing.  
Surely not the best option for doing so! But this is old!

# testc #
A quick and dirty way to test C code on the command line.
